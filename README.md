# Running the project
Before running the project, you must create config files.

* `client/src/main/resources/com/arcbees/beestore/client/Config.properties`
* `server/src/main/resources/com/arcbees/beestore/server/Config.properties`

You can find a `.example` file in those folders to use as a base.
